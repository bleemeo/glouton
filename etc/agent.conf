# Agent configuration files are written in yaml.
#
# Configuration could be overridden by files under
# /etc/bleemeo/agent.conf.d/*.conf
# We suggest to create a file under that folder and leave this
# file unchanged.
#
# Files from the agent.conf.d folder are read in dictonary order (e.g.
# 00-defaults.conf is read before 99-custom.conf)

# You can configure tags for your agent
#tags:
#    - web-server
#    - application-1
#    - ...


# logger configuration. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging-config-dictschema

# Bleemeo agent has a simple webserver by default. It listen on localhost:8015
# You can disable it with the following:
# web:
#    enabled: False

# You can define a threshold on ANY metric. You only need to know it's name and
# add an entry like this one:
#   metric_name:
#       low_critical: 1.0
#       low_warning: 2.0
#       high_warning: 3
#       high_critical: 4.2
# You can omit any of the above 4 threshold (or explicitly set it to null).
#
thresholds:
    cpu_used:
        # When cpu_used grow above 90% it is critical. 80 % is warning.
        high_warning: 80
        high_critical: 90
    disk_used_perc:
        high_warning: 80

    net_err_out:
        high_critical: 0

# Additional metric could be retrived over HTTP(s) by the agent.
#
# It expect response to be only one number in a text/plain response.
#
# Example of metrics:
# metric:
#   pull:
#       the_name_of_your_metric:
#           url: http://localhost:8080/myapp/metric/users_count
#           item: myapp  # item to add to the metric. Default to none
#           ssl_check: true  # should SSL certificate be checked? Default to yes
#           interval: 10  # retrive the metric every N seconds, default to 10


# Additional check (TCP or HTTP) could be defined to monitor custom process.
#
# Example of HTTP check:
# service:
#   custom:
#       the_name_of_your_service:
#           port: 8080          # TCP port of your service
#           address: 127.0.0.1  # Optional, default to 127.0.0.1
#           check_type: http    # Optional, default to "tcp". Could be either
#                               # "http" or "tcp"
